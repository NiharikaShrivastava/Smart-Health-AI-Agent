# Smart Health AI Assistant 💊🧠

An AI-powered health assistant that reminds patients to take their medicine on time and predicts heart risk using real-time data. The system is built with a clean, modular structure and is fully deployable using Zopdev’s cloud infrastructure.



## 🔍 Problem Statement

Many people, especially those with chronic conditions, forget to take their medicines due to busy schedules. Some may also miss early signs of heart risk. These gaps in care can lead to serious health issues that could’ve been prevented with timely action.



## 🎯 Solution Overview

This project aims to:
- 🕒 Send timely medicine reminders via voice/text alerts
- ❤️ Predict heart health anomalies using an AI/ML model
- 🚨 Alert doctors/family in case of emergency
- 📊 Log data and display health patterns on a clean dashboard



## ⚙️ Architecture (Flowchart)

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Backend: Flask / Spring Boot (REST APIs)
- AI/ML: Scikit-learn or LSTM model
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS Dashboard (optional)
- Database: SQLite / Firebase
- Deployment: Zopdev Orchestrated Infra (Kubernetes, CI/CD, Monitoring)



## 🚀 Zopdev Integration Plan

- 🛠️ Microservices deployed via Zopdev infra
- 🔁 CI/CD pipelines for model and reminder updates
- 📈 Monitoring with Zopdev dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana)
- ☁️ Secure health data stored on cloud with compliance



## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am Niharika Shrivastava, a 4th-year B.Tech CSE student from Lovely Professional University.

This project matters to me personally because I’ve seen how many people forget their medicine timings due to busy lifestyles and end up ignoring their health. I want to create a system that helps manage their medicine schedules and gently keeps them aware of their health — not to scare them, but to make sure they get timely care when it’s most needed.
